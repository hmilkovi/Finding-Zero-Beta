# Assignment  
In a cyber crime case, a suspect with the e-mail address z3r0b3t404@gmail.com has been identified. Using OSINT, can you find the first and last name of the suspect?

# Possible handles

Using the given e-mail address z3r0b3t404@gmail.com, we assume z3r0b3t404 as a possible user name.

## E-mail addresses
Extrapolating the user name using popular e-mail domains, we get a list of the following additional e-mail addresses:
1.	z3r0b3t404@aol.com

4.	z3r0b3t404@googlemail.com

2.	z3r0b3t404@googlemail.com
3.	z3r0b3t404@hotmail.com

# Findings
## Clear web
### Search engines
1.	Google
2.	Bing
3.	Yandex
4.	DuckDuckGo

All search engines show no relevant pages when looking searching directly for the possible user names and e-mail addresses.

### Online user accounts
To search user accounts online, several tools have been used.
1. Spiderfoot
2. Skiptracer
3. OSINT-SPY

The following user accounts were found:
1. [Destructoid.com](https://www.destructoid.com/?name=z3r0b3t404&a=454331&start=0&chaos=ok)
   * No publicly available ties to other accounts.
   * No publicly available content (posts, following).
   * Creation at 4:21 PM on May 24, 2019

## Deep web:
1. Google
   * “Zero Beta” shows up as the name in Google Hangouts, under the gmail e-mail address.
2. Facebook
   * Facebook accounts linked to the gmail and googlemail e-mail adresses have been disabled.
   * Note: The account recovery page, when inputting: z3r0b3t404@(X)mail.com always give a hit, so: mail.com, dmail.com, kmail.com, gmail.com. Bug? Does this mean (g)mail.com is a false positive?
3. LinkedIn
   * LinkedIn account is present under the gmail e-mail address.

## Data breaches
The user names and e-mail addresses have not been found in any data breaches according to [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

# Oberservations
1. The name "Zero Beta" tied to z3r0b3t403@gmail.com is a pseudonym which explains that the e-mail address is written in [“leetspeak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet), in which it can be read as:  ZeroBeta04@gmail.com.
   * The e-mail address z3r0b3t403@gmail.com has been verified to not exist
   * Zero Beta could have a meaning. Beta can refer to the second letter of the Greek alphabet, or the numeric value 2. Together making: “0B04” or “0204”.
2. E-mail addresses shows little on search engines and have not been compromised by data breaches. This suggests that the e-mail addresses have not been used much and/or for long, and are possibly burner accounts. The creation date of the account on destructoid.com aligns with the possibility that it is a new e-mail address.
